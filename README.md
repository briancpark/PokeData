# PokeData
PokeData is a database and program that uses software engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence techniques to enhance strategy gameplay of Pokemon games. 

Games I plan to cover:
Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen
Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald
Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum
Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver
Pokemon Black/White/Black2/White2

As I'm in quarrantine, I will attempt to play though some Pokemon games and create a database and optimize strategies. I hope a completed tool will be helpful for Pokemon speedrunners and enthusiasts.
